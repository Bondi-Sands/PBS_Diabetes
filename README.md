# PBS_Diabetes

I am utilizing a supply report from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (https://www.pbs.gov.au/info/statistics/dos-and-dop/dos-and-dop) that focuses on prescriptions for diabetes medications. This report allows me to gain insights into the cumulative prescription trends over a certain period of time, helping me better understand the usage patterns and trends of diabetes medications in Australia. I plan to use this data for analysis and visualization purposes, and I will be storing the relevant scripts and code in a GitHub repository.
